           <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?</p>
           <p class="mini-header"><mark class="mini-mark">What is CSS?</mark></p>
           <p>Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.</p>

         <!-- Prerequisites -->
         <section id="Prerequisites" class="main-section">
           <header><mark>Prerequisites</mark></header>
           <p>You should learn the basics of HTML before attempting any CSS. We recommend that you work through our Introduction to HTML module first.</p>
           <p>Once you understand the fundamentals of HTML, we recommend that you learn further HTML and CSS at the same time, moving back and forth between the two topics. This is because HTML is far more interesting and much more fun to learn when you apply CSS, and you can't learn CSS without knowing HTML.</p>

         <!-- Anatomy of a CSS ruleset -->
         <section id="Anatomy_of_a_CSS_ruleset" class="main-section">
           <header><mark>Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</mark></header>
           <p>Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it works:</p>
           <p class="mini-header"><mark class="mini-mark">CSS p declaration color red</mark></p>
           <p>The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts:</p>
           <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png" alt="p selector color: red;" width="400px" height="300px" />
           <p>
             <ul class="anatomy-list">
               <li><span class="mini-header"><mark class="mini-mark">Selector:</mark></span>
This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, elements). To style a different element, change the selector.</li>
               <li><span class="mini-header"><mark class="mini-mark">Declaration:</mark></span>
This is a single rule like color: red;.It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.</li>
               <li><span class="mini-header"><mark class="mini-mark">Properties:</mark></span>
These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.</li>
               <li><span class="mini-header"><mark class="mini-mark">Property value:</mark></span>
To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)</li>
             </ul>
           </p>
         </section>


         <!-- Comments -->
         <section id="Comments" class="main-section">
           <header><mark>Comments</mark></header>
           <p>As with any coding work, it is best practice to write comments along with CSS. This helps you to remember how the code works as you come back later for fixes or enhancement. It also helps others understand the code.</p>
           <p>CSS comments begin with /* and end with */. In the example below, comments mark the start of distinct sections of code. This helps to navigate the codebase as it gets larger. With this kind of commenting in place, searching for comments in your code editor becomes a way to efficiently find a section of code.</p>
           <pre>
           <code>
/*.special {
  color: red;
}*/

p {
  color: blue;
}
           </code>
           </pre>
         </section>


         <!-- Type, class, and ID selectors -->
         <section id="Type,_class,_and_ID_selectors" class="main-section">
           <header><mark>Type, class, and ID selectors</mark></header>
           <p class="mini-header"><mark class="mini-mark">Type selectors</mark></p>
           <p>A type selector is sometimes referred to as a tag name selector or element selector because it selects an HTML tag/element in your document. In the example below, we have used the span, em and strong selectors.</p>
           <p class="mini-header"><mark class="mini-mark">The universal selector</mark></p>
           <p>The universal selector is indicated by an asterisk (*). It selects everything in the document (or inside the parent element if it is being chained together with another element and a descendant combinator). In the following example, we use the universal selector to remove the margins on all elements. Instead of the default styling added by the browser — which spaces out headings and paragraphs with margins — everything is close together.</p>
           <pre>
           <code>
/*universal*/

* {
    margin: 0;
}
           </code>
           </pre>
           <p class="mini-header"><mark class="mini-mark">Class selectors</mark></p>
           <P>The class selector starts with a dot (.) character. It will select everything in the document with that class applied to it. In the live example below we have created a class called highlight, and have applied it to several places in my document. All of the elements that have the class applied are highlighted.</p>
           <pre>
           <code>
/*class*/

.highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
}
           </code>
           </pre>
           <p class="mini-header"><mark class="mini-mark">ID selectors</mark></p>
           <p>An ID selector begins with a # rather than a dot character, but is used in the same way as a class selector. However, an ID can be used only once per page, and elements can only have a single id value applied to them. It can select an element that has the id set on it, and you can precede the ID with a type selector to only target the element if both the element and ID match. </p>
           <pre>
           <code>
/*id*/

#one {
    background-color: yellow;
}
           </code>
           </pre>
         </section>


         <!-- The box model -->
         <section id="The_box_model" class="main-section">
           <header><mark>The box model</mark></header>
           <p class="mini-header"><mark class="mini-mark">Block and inline boxes</mark></p>
           <p>In CSS we broadly have two types of boxes — block boxes and inline boxes. The type refers to how the box behaves in terms of page flow and in relation to other boxes on the page. Boxes have an inner display type and an outer display type.</p>
           <p>In general, you can set various values for the display type using the display property, which can have various values.</p>
           <p class="mini-header"><mark class="mini-mark">Box Model</mark></p>
           <p>Making up a block box in CSS we have the:</p>
           <p>
             <ul class="box-model-list">
               <li><span class="mini-header"><mark class="mini-mark">Content box:</mark></span> The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height.</li>
               <li><span class="mini-header"><mark class="mini-mark">Padding box:</mark></span> The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties</li>
               <li><span class="mini-header"><mark class="mini-mark">Border box:</mark></span> The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.</li>
               <li><span class="mini-header"><mark class="mini-mark">Margin box:</mark></span> The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties.</li>
             </ul>
           </p>
           <pre>
           <code>
.box {
  width: 350px;
  height: 150px;
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 25px;
  border: 5px solid black;
}
           </code>
